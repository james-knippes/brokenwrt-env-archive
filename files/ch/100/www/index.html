<h3>Hello, this is BrokenWrt</h3>
<p>A vulnerable Router Firmware designed to exercise network attacks.<br>
I've hidden some flags for you. Some are easy to find. Others may be harder to get.</p>

<p>As this is a development build there are some rules/infos/tips:<br>
- don't plug into the management port => lan 4 . there is nothing to gain.<br>
- don't unplug the usb sticks.<br>
- lan ports 1-3 contain multiple challenges (NAME:ch_1XX) <br>
- there are two(/three?) wifi challenges (SSID:ch_00X) <br>
- when you get into the container don't try to break it/out<br>
- when you want internet plug an uplink into the wan port<br>
- you may intercept/mitm traffic from the wan port if needed<br>
- besides the flags there are often some hints for other challenges<br>
- take note of evey information you find. it may be helpfull later<br>
- don't boot the router into failsafe mode<br>
</p>

<p>In good judo manner our safeword for this challenge will be 'Matte' ("mah-teh").<br>
Whenever you read "Matte: $something" you should follow the instructions to have a smooth experience.<br></p>
